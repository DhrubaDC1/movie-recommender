# Dev Journal — Movie Recommender

A human-paced build log. Challenges, wins, and honest notes as the project grows.

---

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1

### 09:00 — Project Kickoff

Started fresh. Empty directory, blank slate. The goal: an LLM-powered movie recommendation system based on my research paper. Cinematic UI, RAG pipeline under the hood, Groq for inference.

Stack decided:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB + `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` embeddings
- **LLM**: Groq API (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) with comparative + CoT prompting
- **Data**: IMDB Top 1000 CSV seed dataset + TMDB API for live posters/metadata

Initialized git, created the GitHub repo, wrote this journal. Let's go.

**Feature order:**
1. ✅ Project foundation (structure, configs, envs)
2. ✅ Backend: FastAPI + all recommender modules
3. ✅ Frontend: Landing page + Results page (full UI)
4. ✅ Final polish, docs, ready to run

---

### 09:45 — Feature 2: Backend — FastAPI server + all recommender modules

Sat down after coffee and knocked out the entire backend in one shot:

- `main.py` — FastAPI app with lifespan service loading, CORS, three routes (`/health`, `/search-movies`, `/recommend`)
- `recommender/tmdb_client.py` — async HTTPX client for TMDB search, movie details, watch providers
- `recommender/embedder.py` — E5 sentence-transformer with proper `query:` / `passage:` prefixes
- `recommender/vector_store.py` — ChromaDB persistent collection with cosine distance
- `recommender/reranker.py` — two-stage hybrid scoring (semantic 70% + quality 30%)
- `recommender/llm_engine.py` — Groq async client with comparative + CoT prompt, JSON extraction
- `setup_vectordb.py` — one-time ingestion script for IMDB Top 1000 CSV

**Challenge**: ChromaDB returns cosine *distance* (0–2), not similarity. Had to convert: `similarity = 1.0 - distance`. Easy fix once spotted.

**Also**: The Groq response sometimes wraps JSON in markdown code fences. Added a regex fallback `re.search(r"\[.*\]", text, re.DOTALL)` in `_parse_json` to handle it gracefully.

Syntax-checked all files — all clean. Committing.

---

### 11:30 — Feature 3: Frontend — Landing page + Results page (full UI)

After the coffee break, dug into the frontend. This is where I wanted the design to really shine.

**What got built:**
- `globals.css` — custom CSS variables, glass/glassmorphism utilities, keyframe animations (slow-pan, fade-up, pulse-glow)
- `HeroBackground.tsx` — dual mode: collage of blurred movie posters (landing) OR blurred backdrop from top recommendation (results)
- `MovieSearchInput.tsx` — debounced TMDB autocomplete with poster thumbnails in dropdown, keyboard Enter support
- `PreferenceTag.tsx` — animated pill tags (green/red for liked/disliked) with Framer Motion enter/exit
- `RecommendationCard.tsx` — full movie card: poster, rank badge, genre pills, IMDB gold rating, LLM explanation with red accent border, streaming badges
- `StreamingBadge.tsx` — provider logos row
- `app/page.tsx` — cinematic landing with hero, two-column preference input, animated CTA
- `app/results/page.tsx` — loading state with spinner, error state with retry, staggered card reveal

**Challenge hit**: Next.js 16 static build fails if `useSearchParams()` isn't wrapped in `<Suspense>`. Fixed by splitting `ResultsContent` (with hooks) from a `ResultsPage` wrapper that provides the `<Suspense>` boundary.

**Build result**: Clean. All 3 routes prerendered as static. TypeScript 0 errors.

---

### 12:15 — Final Polish & Wrap-up

Did a final sweep:
- Updated JOURNAL with complete build log
- All 3 PRs merged into `main`
- Git history is clean and feature-branched as intended

**What the project looks like now:**

```
movie-recommender/
├── backend/           ← FastAPI + RAG pipeline (complete)
├── frontend/          ← Next.js cinematic UI (complete)
├── JOURNAL.md         ← you're reading it
└── README.md
```

**To run it yourself:**
1. Get a TMDB API key (free at themoviedb.org)
2. Get a Groq API key (free at console.groq.com)
3. Download IMDB Top 1000 CSV from Kaggle → `backend/data/imdb_top_1000.csv`
4. `cd backend && cp .env.example .env` → fill in keys
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup_vectordb.py`
6. `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`
7. `cd frontend && npm install && cp .env.example .env.local && npm run dev`

**Reflections:**
- The two-stage reranker was the cleanest implementation — once you understand that ChromaDB gives you distances not similarities, everything falls into place.
- The Groq JSON extraction regex was a worthwhile defensive measure. LLMs *will* wrap output in markdown fences.
- Next.js 16's stricter Suspense requirements for `useSearchParams` caught me — good habit to always wrap search-param hooks.
- The CSS slow-pan animation on the poster collage gives the landing page a beautiful, alive feeling without any JS overhead.

**What's missing (future work):**
- User accounts / saved preferences
- More than 1000 movies in the vector DB (full TMDB catalog via their export)
- A/B testing between Groq models

Day 1 complete. Ship it. 🎬

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (evening)

### 15:30 — Feature 5: User Auth System (JWT + httpOnly cookies)

Two new features requested: auth system + post-recommendation feedback loop. Starting with auth — everything else builds on top of it.

**Backend:**
- `db.py` — added `users` table (id, email, username, password_hash, created_at) and `movie_feedback` table (user_id, movie_title, opinion, source, timestamp). Added full CRUD: `create_user`, `get_user_by_email/id/username`, `upsert_movie_feedback`, `get_user_feedback_history`. UNIQUE index on (user_id, movie_title) so rating a movie twice updates rather than duplicates.
- `auth.py` — JWT with `python-jose` (HS256, 7-day expiry), bcrypt password hashing via `passlib`. Routes: POST /auth/signup, POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout, GET /auth/me. Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies so JS can't read them (XSS-safe). Two FastAPI dependencies: `get_current_user` (raises 401) and `get_optional_user` (returns None).
- `main.py` — CORS updated with `allow_credentials=True` (required for cookies). Auth router included. `/recommend` now uses `get_optional_user` — if logged in, it fetches up to 5 historical liked + 3 historical disliked movies and merges them into the query, so results improve with every session.
- Added `POST /user/feedback` and `GET /user/history` routes.

**Frontend:**
- `lib/auth.ts` — all auth API calls with `credentials: "include"` so cookies are sent
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — React context: hydrates from `/auth/me` on mount, exposes login/signup/logout
- `components/AuthModal.tsx` — glassmorphism modal, tabbed Sign In / Create Account, field focus animations, error display
- `components/NavBar.tsx` — shared nav for both pages: logo, auth state (avatar + username + sign out, or Sign in / Join free buttons)
- `app/layout.tsx` — wrapped with `<AuthProvider>`
- `app/page.tsx` — uses `NavBar`, fetches history on login and pre-fills liked/disliked tags, welcome message for returning users

**Challenge**: `allow_credentials=True` in CORS requires `allow_origins` to be explicit (not `*`). Already had explicit origins, so no change needed — just adding the flag was enough.

**What this unlocks**: Every recommend call now merges the user's historical opinions into the query. First session is cold-start; by session 3-4, the system knows them well.

Build: TypeScript clean, Next.js static build passes.

---

### 16:45 — Feature 6: Post-Recommendation Feedback + Rediscovery Loop

This one closes the loop on the whole system — the user can now rate movies they've watched and immediately rediscover using those opinions.

**What was built:**

**`RecommendationCard.tsx` (updated)**
- Added `feedback: FeedbackOpinion` prop and `onFeedback` callback
- Two `FeedbackButton` components (👍 / 👎), always visible bottom-right of each card
- Active state: coloured glow + solid background (green for liked, red for disliked)
- Card border/glow changes to match the selected opinion — visual confirmation
- `saving` prop disables both buttons while the API call is in-flight

**`RediscoverButton.tsx` (new)**
- Sticky floating button, fixed at bottom-center
- Appears via spring animation when `count > 0` (at least one movie rated)
- Shows count: "Rediscover with 3 new opinions →"
- Exits smoothly when count drops to zero

**`results/page.tsx` (heavily updated)**
- `feedback` state: `Record<title, 'liked' | 'disliked' | null>`
- `handleFeedback`: updates local state immediately (optimistic), then persists to DB if user is logged in. Guests get UI feedback but no DB write.
- `extraLikedRef` / `extraDislikedRef`: accumulate feedback across multiple rediscovery rounds (so round 3 builds on rounds 1+2)
- `handleRediscover`: merges accumulated opinions into the liked/disliked lists, calls `fetchRecs` in-place (no navigation), scrolls to top
- `NavBar` now used instead of inline nav
- Hint text "Rate movies you've watched to unlock Rediscovery" shown until first rating

**Challenge**: Rediscovery needed to be *in-place* (no navigation) because the search params URL was the source of truth. Solved by storing extra liked/disliked in `useRef` (persists across renders, doesn't trigger re-render) and passing them directly into `fetchRecs()`.

**Also**: Guest users (not logged in) still get the full UI experience — their feedback is tracked in the event log but not persisted to `movie_feedback`. The hint text under the title card changes based on auth state.

**The full data flywheel now works:**
1. User rates a movie 👍 → stored in `movie_feedback`
2. Next session: history pre-fills liked list
3. `/recommend` merges history into query → better candidates
4. More ratings → better history → better recommendations

Build: TypeScript clean, Next.js static build passes.

### 17:30 — Hotfix: passlib/bcrypt incompatibility (PR #7)

First real run of the server crashed on `POST /auth/signup` with 500. Root cause: `passlib 1.7.4` (abandoned since 2020) is incompatible with `bcrypt 4.x`. Two symptoms in the traceback:
- `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'` — printed as a warning on every startup
- `ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes` — raised during passlib's internal bcrypt wrap-bug detection test, crashing signup entirely

Fix: dropped passlib entirely. `bcrypt` directly needs only two lines:
```python
bcrypt.hashpw(plain.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode()  # hash
bcrypt.checkpw(plain.encode(), hashed.encode())           # verify
```

Verified: correct password → True, wrong password → False. Server now starts clean.

Lesson: don't pin abandoned libraries. passlib has had no release since 2020; the bcrypt ecosystem moved on without it.

---

### 18:00 — Hotfix: Groq rate limit (PR #8)

Hit a 429 from Groq: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` free tier has only 12,000 TPM. With a 10-candidate prompt + 1024-token response, each call burns ~2,000 tokens. A few rapid test requests was enough to hit the wall.

**Two fixes in `llm_engine.py`:**

1. **Switched default model to `llama-3.1-8b-instant`** — 30,000 TPM free limit vs 12,000. Faster too. Quality is slightly lower than 70b but perfectly good for movie recommendations.

2. **Added `_call_with_retry` with up to 3 attempts:**
   - `RateLimitError`: parse the "Please try again in X.Xs" from Groq's error message, sleep for that duration + 1s buffer, then retry
   - `APIStatusError` (5xx): exponential backoff (2^attempt seconds)
   - After max attempts, re-raise so the endpoint returns a real error

3. **Reduced `max_tokens` from 2048 to 1024** — movie recommendation explanations don't need 2048 tokens. Halves token burn per call.

4. **Dropped `Stars` from the candidates block** — director + genre + IMDB rating is enough context for ranking. Saves ~50 tokens per candidate.

With these changes, each call burns ~800-1000 tokens instead of ~2000. Much more headroom on the free tier.

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (continued)

### 14:00 — Feature 4: Interaction & Behaviour Logging

New requirement: log everything users do and what the system does internally, flush to DB every 30 seconds, so we can use the data later to improve recommendations.

**What was built:**

**Backend — `db.py` (new)**
- Async SQLite via `aiosqlite`
- Two tables: `user_events` (frontend interactions) and `pipeline_events` (backend RAG timings)
- `user_events`: session_id, event_type, page, event_data (JSON), client/server timestamp
- `pipeline_events`: session_id, event_type, event_data (JSON), duration_ms, error, timestamp
- Indexed on session_id, event_type, timestamp for future querying

**Backend — `main.py` (updated)**
- `await init_db()` on startup before loading ML services
- New `POST /log-events` endpoint — accepts batch of frontend events, writes to DB via `BackgroundTasks` (non-blocking, doesn't slow the response)
- `/recommend` now fully instrumented with `time.monotonic()` at each RAG stage:
  - embed_ms, vector_search_ms, rerank_ms, tmdb_enrich_ms, llm_ms, total_ms
  - Pipeline event written to DB as background task after every recommendation
- `session_id` threaded through from frontend → recommend request → pipeline log

**Frontend — `lib/logger.ts` (new)**
- Singleton `EventLogger` class
- 30-second `setInterval` flush via `fetch` with `keepalive: true` (survives page navigation)
- `beforeunload` handler for immediate flush on tab close
- On flush failure: events put back at front of buffer so nothing is lost
- Session ID stored in `sessionStorage` so it persists within a tab but not across sessions

**Frontend — events tracked:**
- `page_view` — on both landing and results pages
- `movie_add_liked` / `movie_add_disliked` — when user selects from autocomplete
- `movie_remove_liked` / `movie_remove_disliked` — when they remove a tag
- `discover_click` — with full liked/disliked list at click time; triggers immediate flush before navigation
- `recommendations_received` — titles, ranks, and client-perceived latency
- `recommendations_error` — error message
- `card_view` — via `IntersectionObserver` when a card becomes ≥50% visible (fires once per card)
- `refine_click` — when navigating back, triggers flush

**Challenges:**
- `RecommendationCard` didn't accept `onView` prop originally. Added `IntersectionObserver` pattern with a `viewFired` ref to fire exactly once per card.
- `motion.article` + `ref` required casting `cardRef as React.Ref<HTMLDivElement>` since Framer Motion's `motion.article` generic doesn't infer the element type from the HTML tag automatically.
- `keepalive: true` on the flush fetch is critical — without it, the browser cancels in-flight requests when the page unloads.

**What this data enables later:**
- Most-searched movies (hot autocomplete terms)
- Liked/disliked pair patterns → train better retrieval
- Card view-through rate per rank position (are rank 4/5 ever seen?)
- End-to-end latency tracking per RAG stage
- Error rate monitoring

Build: TypeScript clean. Next.js static build passes.

### 17:30 — Hotfix: env file not loaded on startup

First real run hit a `KeyError: 'TMDB_API_KEY'` immediately. Root cause: `load_dotenv()` with no arguments only looks for `.env`, but the project uses `.env.local`. One-line fix — `load_dotenv(".env.local")` — and the server came up clean: embedding model loaded, ChromaDB collection at 1000 docs, all services ready.

Lesson: name your env file exactly `.env` if you want python-dotenv to find it automatically, or always pass the filename explicitly.

---

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (late evening)

### 18:30 — Hotfix: 264 "Failed to fetch" errors on results page (PR merged to main)

Opened the event logs and found 264 `recommendations_error` entries, all with `"Failed to fetch"`. Four errors had identical timestamps (12:03:35.892Z × 4) — a clear sign of multiple simultaneous requests, not a network problem.

**Root cause** — a React referential stability bug in `frontend/app/results/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// These create new array references on every render:
const liked = searchParams.getAll("liked");
const disliked = searchParams.getAll("disliked");

const fetchRecs = useCallback(async (...) => {
  ...
}, [liked, disliked, sessionId]); // deps always "changed" → recreated every render

useEffect(() => {
  fetchRecs(); // re-fired on every render
}, [fetchRecs]); // caught the recreation → fired again
```

`searchParams.getAll()` returns a new `string[]` instance on every call, even when the values are identical. React's `useCallback` uses `Object.is` comparison — two different array objects are never equal — so `fetchRecs` was recreated on every render. The `useEffect` caught that and re-fired `fetchRecs()`, which aborted the previous in-flight fetch, which the browser reported as `"Failed to fetch"`.

**Fix — three changes:**

1. **`useMemo` on the arrays** — stable reference as long as `searchParams` doesn't change:
   ```typescript
   const liked = useMemo(() => searchParams.getAll("liked"), [searchParams]);
   const disliked = useMemo(() => searchParams.getAll("disliked"), [searchParams]);
   ```

2. **`fetchInitiatedRef` mount guard** — even in edge cases (StrictMode double-invoke, hot reload), the initial fetch runs exactly once:
   ```typescript
   const fetchInitiatedRef = useRef(false);
   useEffect(() => {
     if (fetchInitiatedRef.current) return;
     fetchInitiatedRef.current = true;
     const controller = new AbortController();
     fetchRecs([], [], controller.signal);
     return () => controller.abort();
   }, [fetchRecs]);
   ```

3. **`AbortController` threaded through** — so navigating away mid-fetch aborts cleanly, and the `AbortError` is silently swallowed (not logged as a real error):
   ```typescript
   catch (e: unknown) {
     if (e instanceof Error && e.name === "AbortError") return;
     // ... real error handling
   }
   ```

Also forwarded `signal` to `getRecommendations` in `lib/api.ts` so it reaches the actual `fetch()` call.

**Result**: Exactly one POST `/recommend` per page load. Error events in the DB: zero for normal loads. Rediscovery (user-triggered) unchanged.

Lesson: `searchParams.getAll()` is a call that allocates a new array every time. Never put it raw into `useCallback` deps — always memoize first.

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (night)

### 19:30 — Feature 7: Reliable Movie Thumbnails + Language Preference Filter

Two features in one branch (`feat/thumbnails-and-language-filter`).

**Feature 1 — Reliable Thumbnails**

The `RecommendationCard` already had a poster `<img>` tag, but if the TMDB URL failed to load (network error, wrong title match, movie not in TMDB), the image would silently break. Fixed with:

- `imgError` state + `onError={() => setImgError(true)}` on the img tag
- `PosterFallback` component: cinema-red gradient background + movie initials extracted from the title (up to two words). Renders when `poster_url` is null OR when the image load fails.
- Poster column widened: 120px→130px (mobile), 160px→175px (desktop). `self-stretch` ensures it fills the full card height.

**Feature 2 — Language Preference Filter**

Flow: Landing page → URL params → Results page → API body → Backend filter → LLM hint.

*Frontend (`page.tsx`):*
- Four multi-select language pills: **English, Hindi, Bangla, Others**
- Cinema-red glow when active; neutral glass when inactive
- "No filter — recommends from all languages" helper text when nothing selected
- Selected languages appended to URL as `?language=English&language=Hindi`

*Frontend (`results/page.tsx` + `api.ts`):*
- `languages` read from URL params (memoized like `liked`/`disliked`)
- Passed into `getRecommendations` → POST body `languages: [...]`
- Results nav subtitle shows active filter: "Based on: Inception · Hindi"

*Backend:*
- `_LANG_ISO` map: `{"English": "en", "Hindi": "hi", "Bangla": "bn"}`
- `"Others"` = anything NOT in `[en, hi, bn]`
- **Soft-sort** (not hard-filter): preferred-language candidates go first in the list, the rest are appended. This means we always return `num_results` results even if the IMDB Top 1000 has zero Bengali films — the LLM just gets them ranked lower.
- TMDB `_enrich()` now returns `original_language` from the search result (no extra API call — it's already in the search response).
- `rank_and_explain` updated: `PREFERRED LANGUAGES: {languages}` added to the CoT prompt. LLM prioritises matching languages when quality is otherwise equal.

**Challenge**: The PR merge kept targeting `feat/project-foundation` (the repo's default branch is wrong). Fixed by merging directly to `main` locally and pushing.

**Lesson (soft vs hard filter)**: Hard-filtering by language in a small dataset (1000 English-majority films) would leave users with Bengali preference getting 0 results. Soft-sort keeps UX intact while still honouring the preference wherever possible.

Build: TypeScript clean. All changes on `main`.

---

### 20:15 — Hotfix: Language filter not reflected in results

User reported language selection had no visible effect. Traced the pipeline and found three separate issues:

**Root cause 1 — Candidate pool too small**

`n_candidates = req.num_results * 2 = 10`. The IMDB Top 1000 dataset has a small number of Hindi films (Dangal, 3 Idiots, Lagaan, etc.) and essentially zero Bangla films. If the semantic search returns 10 candidates and the soft-sort only finds 1–2 Hindi matches in that pool, the LLM still gets 8 English films and will rank them higher by default.

Fix: `n_candidates = req.num_results * (4 if req.languages else 2)` — double the pool when a language filter is active to give the soft-sort more material.

**Root cause 2 — Vector query had no language signal**

The embedding query was `"Movies similar to: Inception."` — no mention of language anywhere. ChromaDB finds thematically similar movies, which are overwhelmingly English.

Fix: Prepend the language to the query: `"Hindi/Bangla movies similar to: Inception."` — the multilingual E5 embedding encodes this, biasing retrieval toward Indian cinema.

**Root cause 3 — LLM couldn't see the language of each candidate**

The candidates block showed title/genre/rating/director but NOT language. The LLM had to guess which films were Hindi from its own training knowledge — for lesser-known films it would have no idea. And the instruction was "prioritise when quality is otherwise equal" — a soft hint the LLM could silently ignore.

Fix: Added `Language: Hindi` to every candidate line (ISO code → full name via `_ISO_TO_NAME` dict). Hardened the LANGUAGE RULE in the prompt: "you MUST rank films whose Language field matches a preferred language above films that do not match, as long as any language-matching candidate exists."

Lesson: A language filter only works if all three of (retrieval, sorting, LLM visibility) respect it. Fixing just one layer is insufficient.

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (night, continued)

### 21:00 — Feature 8: Real-time TMDB Discovery (replaces ChromaDB + IMDB CSV)

The core problem: the IMDB Top 1000 CSV is static and old. No 2023 or 2024 film could ever appear. The entire retrieval step has been replaced with TMDB's live `/discover/movie` API.

**Old pipeline:**
```
liked titles → E5 embed → ChromaDB ANN (IMDB Top 1000 only) → IMDB metadata → LLM rank
```

**New pipeline:**
```
liked titles → TMDB genre+keyword lookup (parallel)
             → TMDB /discover/movie (real-time, millions of movies)
             → quality rerank (vote_average + vote_count + popularity)
             → streaming enrich (parallel)
             → LLM comparative + CoT rank
```

**`tmdb_client.py` — three new methods:**
- `get_movie_meta(title)` — searches TMDB for a liked movie and returns its `genre_ids` + `keyword_ids` (via the keywords endpoint). Used to seed the discover call.
- `discover_movies(genre_ids, keyword_ids, language_code, page)` — calls `/discover/movie` with OR-combined genre and keyword filters, sorted by popularity. Returns fully-formatted dicts (poster, backdrop, year, genre string, language, vote scores) from the search result alone — no extra detail API call.
- `enrich_with_streaming(tmdb_id)` — fetches streaming providers only (replaces the heavier `_enrich` call that also fetched genres we no longer need).
- Added `TMDB_GENRES` hardcoded dict (19 entries) — maps genre IDs to names without an API call.

**`reranker.py` — new `rerank_tmdb` method:**
- Replaces IMDB/Metascore scoring with TMDB fields: `vote_average` (50%) + `vote_count` (30%) + `popularity` (20%). All log-normalized before combining.

**`main.py` — major refactor:**
- Removed `Embedder` and `VectorStore` from lifespan — saves ~500 MB RAM at startup.
- Step 1: parallel `get_movie_meta()` for up to 3 liked movies.
- Step 2: parallel `discover_movies()` — one request per language per page (2 pages each).
- Fallback: if keyword filter returns too few results, retry with genre-only.
- Step 3: dedup by `tmdb_id`, filter mentioned movies.
- Step 4: `rerank_tmdb()` + language soft-sort.
- Step 5: parallel `enrich_with_streaming()` for top N*2 candidates.
- Step 6: LLM ranking (unchanged).

**What this unlocks:**
- Latest releases (TMDB discover returns current movies sorted by popularity)
- Any language's catalogue — Hindi, Bangla, Korean, French, etc. (TMDB native filter)
- Faster startup (no 500 MB embedding model load)
- More semantically relevant results (keyword-based genre matching is more precise than vector similarity over a 1000-movie set)

**Caveat:** The IMDB CSV + ChromaDB setup (`setup_vectordb.py`) still works if you want the old approach — the code is untouched, just not used by the server anymore.

---

### 22:00 — Hotfix: Intermittent missing movie thumbnails

Some recommendation cards were rendering without a poster even when TMDB had one. The root cause was in how the backend maps LLM output back to candidate metadata.

**Root cause — LLM title rephrasing breaks the lookup**

The LLM was asked to return each film's title in the JSON output. For most films this was exact, but for some it would rephrase: `"Se7en"` → `"Seven"`, `"2001: A Space Odyssey"` → `"2001 A Space Odyssey"`, `"Léon: The Professional"` → `"Leon"`. The backend was doing an exact `title.lower()` match to find the candidate dict (and attach `poster_url`). When the match failed, `match = {}`, so `poster_url` became `None`.

**Fix — three-tier lookup in `main.py`:**

```python
# 1. candidate_index: ask LLM to return the 1-based index from the list (added to prompt)
idx = rec.get("candidate_index")
if isinstance(idx, int) and 1 <= idx <= len(top_candidates):
    match = top_candidates[idx - 1]  # exact array position, immune to rephrasing

# 2. exact title match (case-insensitive fallback)
if not match:
    match = next((c for c in top_candidates if c["title"].lower() == rec["title"].lower()), {})

# 3. fuzzy match via difflib (catches minor variants, cutoff=0.6 avoids false positives)
if not match:
    close = get_close_matches(rec["title"], candidate_titles, n=1, cutoff=0.6)
    if close:
        match = next(c for c in top_candidates if c["title"] == close[0])
```

**Updated LLM prompt** (`llm_engine.py`): added `"candidate_index": <the number shown before the film>` to the JSON schema example. The LLM reliably returns the index (1-based, matching the `1. Title` prefix in the candidates block), making tier-1 the dominant path.

**Frontend improvement** (`RecommendationCard.tsx`):
- Shimmer skeleton shown while poster image loads (`imgLoaded` state)
- Image fades in smoothly: `opacity: imgLoaded ? 1 : 0, transition: "opacity 0.3s"`
- `loading="lazy"` added — defers offscreen image fetches, reduces layout jank
- `PosterFallback` (gradient + initials) already covered the null case — now also covers `onError` (broken TMDB URLs)

**Result**: Posters now appear consistently across all recommendations. The three-tier lookup means even heavily rephrased titles (LLM translating foreign titles, using subtitles instead of main titles) still find their TMDB metadata.

---

### 22:45 — Feature 9: Era / Time-Period Filter

Users can now specify which era of movies they want — a single-select pill row on the landing page.

**Four options (single-select, toggle to deselect):**
- **Latest** (2022–now)
- **2010s** (2010–2019)
- **2000s** (2000–2009)
- **Classics** (before 2000)

No selection = any release year (default).

**How the filter works end-to-end:**

*Frontend (`page.tsx`):*
- `ERA_OPTIONS` constant with `label` + `sub` (year range hint displayed inside the pill)
- `selectedEra` state — string, empty means no filter
- Clicking the active pill deselects: `setSelectedEra(active ? "" : label)`
- Appended to URL: `?era=Latest`

*Frontend (`results/page.tsx` + `api.ts`):*
- `era` read from URL params; passed into `getRecommendations` → POST body
- Shown in nav subtitle: "Based on: Inception · Hindi · 2010s"

*Backend (`main.py`):*
- `_ERA_DATES` dict maps labels to `(date_gte, date_lte)` tuples:
  ```python
  _ERA_DATES = {
      "Latest":   ("2022-01-01", None),
      "2010s":    ("2010-01-01", "2019-12-31"),
      "2000s":    ("2000-01-01", "2009-12-31"),
      "Classics": (None,        "1999-12-31"),
  }
  ```
- `date_gte` and `date_lte` computed once, then passed into every `discover_movies()` call

*Backend (`tmdb_client.py`):*
- `discover_movies()` now accepts `date_gte` and `date_lte` optional params
- Forwarded as TMDB query params: `primary_release_date.gte` / `primary_release_date.lte`
- TMDB enforces the filter server-side — no post-hoc filtering needed on our end

*Backend (`llm_engine.py`):*
- `PREFERRED ERA: {era}` added to the `RANK_PROMPT`
- ERA RULE step: "prefer films whose year falls within that era, as secondary to taste quality"
- `era` field now in `rank_and_explain()` signature

**Why TMDB-native filtering is the right approach:**
Post-hoc filtering would mean: retrieve N candidates → throw some away → maybe return fewer than `num_results`. TMDB's date params filter at the source — every candidate already satisfies the era constraint, so we always get a full result set.

**Logged in pipeline events**: era included in the backend `pipeline_event` record for analytics.

Build: TypeScript clean. Committed to `feat/time-period-filter`, merged to `main`.

## 2026-05-26 — Day 1 (late night)

### 23:30 — Feature 10: CineSwipe — Tinder-style movie rating game

New feature: a swipe-to-rate game that keeps users engaged while also collecting rich taste-profile data.

**Flow:**
1. Language selection screen (English / Hindi / Bangla / Others — multi-select, same options as the main filter)
2. Swipe game — top-rated movies shown as a stack of cards, one at a time
3. Three actions per card: ♥ Liked | ✕ Disliked | ? Haven't Watched
4. Done screen showing stats, with a "Get Recommendations →" shortcut

**The data flywheel:**
- `Liked` / `Disliked` → persisted to `movie_feedback` with `source: "swipe_game"`
- These feed directly into the existing `/recommend` pipeline's user-history merge (already implemented in Feature 5) — no code changes needed there
- `Haven't Watched` → skipped this round (can return once more per session), never stored
- Once a movie is liked or disliked, it's excluded from future game rounds (`get_all_rated_titles` query)

**Backend — `GET /game/movies`:**

```python
@app.get("/game/movies")
async def game_movies(language: list[str] = Query(default=[]), page: int = Query(default=1, ge=1), ...):
```

- Calls `tmdb.get_top_rated(language_code, page)` — a new method using `sort_by=vote_average.desc&vote_count.gte=300`
- Fetches 2 TMDB pages per selected language in parallel (via `asyncio.gather`)
- Deduplicates by `tmdb_id`, sorts by `(vote_average, vote_count)` DESC
- For authenticated users: fetches all rated titles via `get_all_rated_titles(user_id)` and filters them out before returning
- Returns up to 20 movies per call

**`db.py` — `get_all_rated_titles(user_id)`:**
- New function that returns ALL movie titles the user has ever rated (no limit) as a lowercase set
- Used exclusively by the game endpoint — recommendations still use `get_user_feedback_history` with a recency limit

**Frontend — `GameCard` component:**

The card handles its own animation lifecycle via an `exitDir` state:
- `useMotionValue` + `useTransform` for smooth drag tracking
- LIKE/NOPE stamps fade in as the user drags (green right, red left) using `useTransform` on opacity
- On drag release > 110px threshold → `setExitDir` → Framer Motion `animate` prop drives the fly-off
- On button press → `useImperativeHandle` exposes `triggerAction()` so parent can drive the same exit animation
- `onAnimationComplete` callback fires AFTER the exit animation, then calls `onAction` to notify the parent
- This design ensures the card always flies off before the deck updates — no jarring jump cuts

**Frontend — `GamePage` (three-phase state machine):**
- `"language-select"` → `"playing"` → `"done"`, managed with `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` for smooth phase transitions
- Card stack: top card (`deck[0]`) is the interactive `GameCard`, next two (`deck[1]`, `deck[2]`) are read-only `GhostCard` components rendered at `scale(0.94, 0.88)` and translated down, giving depth without interaction complexity
- Auto-fetch: `useEffect` watches `deck.length` — when it drops below 5, fetches the next page in the background. User never sees an empty deck in practice.
- `skippedOnce` flag on each deck card: Haven't Watched sends the card to the end of the queue; if it comes up again and the user skips again, it's removed (prevents infinite loops on short decks)
- Guest users see the full game UI; their actions update local state but don't call `submitFeedback`

**Discovery in the UI:**
- NavBar: cinema-red "🎬 CineSwipe" pill link (hidden on the game page itself to avoid redundancy)
- Home page: a CTA banner below the main form explaining the game and linking to it

**Why the `useImperativeHandle` pattern:**
The action buttons are inside the card (bottom section) so they're part of the draggable element's UI. Clicking them needs to start the card's internal exit animation, then notify the parent. `forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle` exposes a `triggerAction(action)` method on the card, which the parent calls when it wants to programmatically trigger an action (e.g., from external keyboard shortcuts or accessibility controls). The card remains the single source of truth for its animation state.

Build: TypeScript 0 errors. Next.js static build: `/game` prerendered. Merged to `main`.
